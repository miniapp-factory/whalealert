2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` (create this file if it does not yet exist)

I need the `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file added to the chat so I can create the logo image description. Once that file is added, I’ll provide the edits for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`.

A stylized whale silhouette in deep blue against a dark navy gradient background, with a glowing trail of cryptocurrency symbols (BTC, ETH, SOL) flowing from its mouth, representing large crypto transactions. The whale should appear dynamic and powerful, with subtle waves around it, and the background should be a gradient from deep navy to black, giving a sense of depth and movement.
